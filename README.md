robot simulation

Program  description
 
This assignment simulates a robot moving around in a 2-dimensional world, looking for coins. The robot’s current location is represented by an (x, y) point in space. Imagine that the robot has a controller that receives commands  one at a time. Each command will tell it to move forward or turn 90 degrees, either clockwise or anti-clockwise.  The program will have a broad control loop, and for each iteration of the loop, the robot must decide what to do (i.e., which command to execute). The goal is for the robot to locate all the coins hidden in its world. The robot’s world is 10 × 10 units in size, and the x and y coordinates are in the range [0, 9] (i.e., from 0 to 9, inclusive).
